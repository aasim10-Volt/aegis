"""Build a Cohort from the uploaded mock student set.

The mock files (``student_profiles.json``) carry *students only* — and on a 1–10
declared scale with pillar names + an LMS-flavoured ``basis`` vocabulary. This
adapter maps them into the engine's domain (1–5 scale, four disciplines, engine
``confidence_basis`` vocab) and deterministically generates the pieces the engine
needs but the mock lacks: projects, availability, roles, an activity log, and
per-team monitoring. Deterministic (index-based, no RNG) so every load is identical.

This is an impure edge: it depends on ``domain`` only and is never imported by
``engine/``. The same Cohort it returns is what ``scripts/load_supabase.py`` writes
to Supabase and what ``repo_db`` later reads back.
